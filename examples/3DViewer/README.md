# 3D Viewer
This program can open an OBJ file and render it in a window. The OBJ file must contain vertices and normals and the faces are expected to be triangles, not quads.

## Example usage
[Build](../../README.md) the examples. Then run:

    cd examples/3DViewer/; ./3DViewer ../../../examples/3DViewer/data/test.obj; cd -
Use the left and right arrows on the keyboard to rotate the object.
