abstract = {This Lab invites participants to explore how today’s Vulkan ecosystem tools and resources allow everyone to write real-time ray-traced effects with far less boilerplate than in the past. Building on a trimmed version of the open-source Khronos Vulkan Tutorial [Khronos 2025a] and the vk-bootstrap [Giessen 2025] and Vulkan-RAII [Khronos 2025c] helper libraries, we will incrementally assemble a renderer that combines rasterization with ray tracing to implement accurate shadows. The session balances bite-sized coding intervals with short concept discussions, so that every participant leaves with a runnable project and a mental map of where to dig deeper afterward.},
